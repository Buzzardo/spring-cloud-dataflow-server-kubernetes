== Deploying Streams on Kubernetes

In this getting started guide, the Admin server is run as a standalone application outside the kubernetes cluster.  This also requires running a local instance of Redis to store available modules.  A future version will allow the admin server itself to run on kubernetes.

. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster.
+ 
The http://kubernetes.io/gettingstarted/[Kubernetes getting started guide] lets you choose among many deployment options so you can pick one that you are most comfortable using.  Of note, the https://github.com/olmoser/docker-compose-kubernetes[docker-compose-kubernetes] is not among those options but was used by the developers of this project to run a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker Compose.  
+
The rest of this getting started guide assumes that you have a working Kubernetes cluster and a `kubectl` command line.
+
. Create a redis service on the Kubernetes cluster.
+
The redis service will be used for messaging between modules in the stream.  There are sample replication controller and service YAML files in the `spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-kubernetes` repository that you can use as a starting point as they have the required metadata set for service discovery by the modules.  
+
If you are deploying a Kubernetes cluster outside your local machine, setting the service to be a LoadBalancer type will give you an external IP address to connect to the redis instance.  
+ 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-kubernetes
$ cd spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-kubernetes
$ kubectl create -f src/etc/kubernetes/redis-controller.yml
$ kubectl create -f src/etc/kubernetes/redis-service.yml
```
Note that it can take a minute or so until there is an external IP address for the redis server.  Use the command `kubectl get services` to check on the state of the service.  Use the command `kubectl delete service redis` to clean up afterwards.
+
. Determine the location of your Kubernetes Master URL, for example:
+
```
$ kubectl cluster-info

Kubernetes master is running at https://104.154.90.44

   ...other output omitted...
```
. Export environment variables to connect to Kubernetes.
+
The admin server uses the https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client[fabric8 Java client library] to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.  It can be configured using system properites, environment variables, and the Kube config file.  In testing using the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/[Google Container Engine], only setting the environment variables `KUBERNETES_MASTER` and `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` were required.  Other configuration values were read from the Kube config file.
+
```
$ export KUBERNETES_MASTER=https://104.154.90.44/
$ export KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=default
```
+
This approach supports using one admin server instance per Kubernetes namespace.
+
. Run a local redis-server.
+
```
$ redis-sever
```
+
This is used by the locally running admin server to store the state of available module versions for stream definitions.
+
NOTE: If you are switching between milestone and snapshot versions of the admin server, flush the redis keys that contain the module's version information.  Calling `flushdb` is indiscriminate but a handy way to start from a clean redis state.
+
. Download and run the Spring Cloud Dataflow Admin server for Kubernetes.
+
```
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-kubernetes/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-kubernetes-1.0.0.M1.jar

$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-kubernetes-1.0.0.M1.jar
```
+
Ensure that the admin is running in the same terminal session that has the Kubernetes environment variables set.
+
. Download and run the Spring Cloud Dataflow shell.
+
```
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.0.0.M2/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M2.jar

$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M2.jar
```
+
. Deploy a simple stream in the shell
+
```
dataflow:>stream create --name ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy
```
+
You can use the command `kubectl get pods` to check on the state of the pods corresponding to this stream.  
+
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-d207a           1/1       Running   0          50m
ticktock-log-qnk72    0/1       Running   2          1m
ticktock-time-r65cn   0/1       Running   3          1m
```
+
Look at the logs for the pod deployed for the log sink.
+
```
$ kubectl logs ticktock-log-qnk72
```
A useful command to help in troubleshooting issues, such as a container that has a fatal error starting up, add the options ``--prvious` to view last terminated container log.
