== Introducing Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Data Flow is a toolkit for building data integration and real-time data processing pipelines.

Pipelines consist of Spring Boot apps, built using the Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Cloud Task microservice frameworks. This makes Spring Cloud Data Flow suitable for a range of data processing use cases, from import/export to event streaming and predictive analytics.

This project provides support for using Spring Cloud Data Flow with Kubernetes as the runtime for these pipelines with apps packaged as Docker images.
